      Media is used extensively today, and the Web is one of the primary
      means of consuming media content. Many browsers show content
      recommendations in their UI. This specification aims to enable web
      sites to specify a feed of personalized media recommendations that
      can be fetched by the browser and displayed in the browser UI. By
      improving media discovery this would improve the user experience
      as well as providing web sites with a new way of reaching users.

    <p>
      Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as
      "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and terminate
      these steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word
      ("must", "should", "may", etc) used in introducing the algorithm.
    </p>

    <p>
      Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be
      implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent.
      (In particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are
      intended to be easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Unless otherwise stated, string comparisons are done in a
      <a data-cite="HTML#case-sensitive">case-sensitive</a> manner.
